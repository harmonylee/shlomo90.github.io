# JH's Homepage

Hello! Everyone?  
My name is JaeHwan Lim. I am maintaining this ugly blog for organizing my knowledge.  
This blog focuses on Computer Network and Linux Kernel that I am digging into.  
You may feel strange when you read my items written in English. To be honest, I am not good at English but I wanna use English for anyone to be able to read and little bit improving my English.
I hope all people who visit my blog would be helpful.
