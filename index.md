# JH's Homepage

Hello! Everyone. My name is JaeHwan Lim. I am maintaining this ugly blog for organizing my knowledge and writing down what I am digging into.  
You may feel strange when you read my items written in English. To be honest, I am not good at English but I wanna spread knowledge as possible as I can with using English.  
I hope all people who visit my blog would be helpful.
